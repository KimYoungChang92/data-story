### About Me

My name is Chaoran, from China and currently residing in Singapore. 10 years ago, I won a scholarship and moved to Singapore for university. I considered myself lucky as I was exempted from either China’s college entry examination or Singapore’s A level test.
My background is B.Eng Chemical Engineering and M.Sc. Industrial Engineering. But now I am a big fan of Data Science.

### About this Blog

About this Blog
Since Jan 2015, I’ve spent about half-year in learning data science. Having explored multiple online courses, quora threads, websites, textbooks, I was toddling around in a sea of new things. The primary motivation of this blog to track the learning journey and to summarize all those useful stuffs I found, so that to put everything in a more structured way.

I believe the best way to learn is to teach and to share. Hope this blog may help someone, who is also learning data science,  in any sense.
